        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="mt-0">
          Hi! I'm Kuvee, a cybersecurity researcher and CTF enthusiast. I specialize in binary exploitation, 
          reverse engineering, and vulnerability research. My passion lies in understanding how systems work 
          at the lowest level and finding creative ways to exploit them.
        </p>
        
        <h3>What I Do</h3>
        <p>
          I participate in various Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions, focusing primarily on pwn challenges. 
          These challenges involve exploiting vulnerabilities in binary programs, understanding memory layouts, 
          and crafting payloads to gain control of execution flow.
        </p>
        
        <h3>This Blog</h3>
        <p>
          This blog serves as my platform to share detailed writeups from CTF competitions, technical analysis 
          of vulnerabilities, and insights into binary exploitation techniques. I believe in learning through 
          teaching, so I try to explain my thought process and the techniques I use in detail.
        </p>
